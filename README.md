#**Smart Irrigation System using ESP32, Soil Moisture Sensor, and Blink IoT App**


This project implements a smart irrigation system using ESP32 microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, water pump, relay, and the Blink IoT platform. The system is designed to automatically monitor soil moisture levels and control the watering of plants based on predefined thresholds, ensuring optimal hydration for plant growth while conserving water resources.

Features
Soil Moisture Monitoring: Utilizes a soil moisture sensor to measure the moisture level in the soil.
Automatic Watering: Automatically triggers the water pump to irrigate the plants when soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.
Customizable Thresholds: Allows users to set custom moisture level thresholds for watering, ensuring flexibility based on plant requirements.
Blink IoT Integration: Integrates with the Blink IoT platform for remote monitoring and control of the irrigation system via a smartphone app.
Real-time Data Visualization: Provides real-time visualization of soil moisture levels and watering activity through the Blink app dashboard.
Manual Override: Includes manual override functionality to allow users to manually trigger watering or pause automated watering when needed.
Low Power Consumption: Optimized for low power consumption to prolong battery life when operating on battery power.
